1.  stdint.h standardizes types for code portability.
    Depending on systems and compilers, a type may not be the same across all,
    but with stdint.h they will be defined clearly
2.  The point of using uint8_t, int32_t, etc. ensures that there are no mistakes made in what type "int" should mean across platforms.
3.  BYTE = 1 byte, DWORD = 4 bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, WORD = 2 bytes
4.  first two bytes must be "BM" for type of BMP file.
5.  bfSize is the size of the bitmap file; biSize is the size of the structure(?) (the type structure? Can it be not 40?)
    per documentation, it is used to locate the color table. But don't we know!? that it is 40, just by the structure itself?
6.  Negative biHeight means that the bitmap picture is stored top down (origin is upper left corner)
7.  color depth?
8.  fopen may return NULL if no file found, or there is not enough disk space to write,
    or the user doesn't have permission to read/write a file, or other problems
9.  1 in fread means to read one element of size "size" (in fread attribute array).
    So in our case, read just one BITMAPINFOHEADER or BITMAPFILEHEADER
10. line 65 copy.c: padding will be 0
11. fseek: sets the file position of the stream to the given offset
12. SEEK_CUR in fseek is a constrant; current position of the file pointer
