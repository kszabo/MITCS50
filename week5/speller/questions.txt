0.  an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.
1.  getrusage: returns resource usage measures (for its first argument)
        self: sum of resources by all threads in the process
2.  16
3.  why pass before/after by reference and not by value? Creating the copies of the values also takes time, so we wan't to avoid calculating with them.
4.  main:
        read in the file character by caracter.
            If current character is alphabetic or a single quote, then append it to the word, move the index,
                    and if word is longer than 45 character, just ignore the rest of word
            if numeric, then just ignore the rest of the word; start a new word (set index = 0);
            if current character is neither alphabetic, alphanumeric, or single quote, then assume it is end of the word:
               append the NULL character.
               increment word counter
               check in dictionary and measure
               if not in dictionary, print on screen and increment counter
               reset index so that next word can be checked
        see if there was any error reading in the text file, and if so, unload the dictionary
        close the text file
        measure dictionary size and measure the time it takes to check size
        unload dictionary and measure the time it takes to unload
        report statistics
5.  fscanf with %s format may not work if there is a word longer than 45 characters long. In that case, the next "word"
        will be the starting with the characters above the 45th character, skewing the total word count.
6.  constants so that we can't modify them even by mistake
